!!! work still in progress at very early stage!!!

This is a simple audio processor based on stm32f1 as my hobby project.

Since I don't have an oscilloscope, I couldn't precisely verify all the input/output graphs and their timings.
But with test meter and potentiometer, I was able to verify that the output voltage matches the input voltage.
The next phase is to design audio I/O circuit and apply DSP.
